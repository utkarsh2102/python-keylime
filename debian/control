Description: TPM-based key bootstrapping and system integrity measurement
 Keylime is an open source scalable trust system harnessing TPM Technology.
 .
 Keylime provides an end-to-end solution for bootstrapping hardware rooted
 cryptographic trust for remote machines, the provisioning of encrypted
 payloads and run-time system integrity monitoring. It also provides a
 flexible framework for the remote attestation of any given `PCR` (Platform
 Configuration Register). Users can create their own customized actions that
 will trigger when a machine fails its attested measurements.
